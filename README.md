Final project for Environmental Analysis: Global Water–Carbon Coupling

This project analyzes global relationships among Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), Evapotranspiration (ET), and Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD) using satellite-derived datasets (SMAP).

The analysis includes:
1. Global time-series trends
2. Monthly climatology
5. Scatterplots of GPP–ET and GPP–VPD
4. Seasonal differences (dry vs wet)
5. Per-pixel spatial correlations
6. Interpretation and conclusion
